# Pentesting-Live-Targets
# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: 11 hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:

* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each color is vulnerable to only 2 of the 6 possible exploits. First discover which color has the specific vulnerability, then write a short description of how to exploit it, and finally demonstrate it using screenshots compiled into a GIF.

## Blue

Vulnerability #1: __________________

Description:

## Green

Vulnerability #1: __Cross-site scripting________________

Description: Entered the name <script>alert('Charles found the XSS!');</script> in the contact/feedback form will execute the script when the staff views the feedback. It would  execute when there is no preceding redirect.

## Red

Vulnerability #1: _Insecure Direct Object Reference_________________

Description:Some code is missing from red that would prevent sensitive information from going public. By changing the id parameter, we can access a profile that isn't supposed to be public (10) until a later date and a profile of a fired employee (11). Blue and green avoid this by redirecting you from ids that aren't supposed to be seen.
